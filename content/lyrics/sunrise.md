**Verse 1**

Another day's a new day a chance that I'll take to see you

I swear I've been waiting oh so long 

I can't sleep and I'll stay awake till I get to see you 

And this night keeps goin on and on



**Pre-Chorus**

I can't keep my mind off of you

There's not much that I can do 

So I'll just keep on lovin you

Till the mornin comes around 



**Chorus**

I wanna see that sunrise over my head (x3)

And I don't wanna wait to see the light 



**Verse 2**

Another night I won't be alright till I get to see you 

It's like time keeps moving in slo-mo-tion

So I'll try to speed up the time till I get to see you

And all night I'll try to control my emotion



**Pre-Chorus**

I can't keep my mind off of you

There's not much that I can do 

So I'll just keep on lovin you

Till the mornin comes around 



**Chorus**

I wanna see that sunrise over my head (x3)

And I don't wanna wait to see the light 



**Bridge**

I can't wait, can't wait, to see that sunrise (x4)



**Chorus**

I wanna see that sunrise over my head (x3)

And I don't wanna wait to see the light
